# Merge two javascript objects

**Summary**: in this tutorial, you will learn how to merge two or more JavaScript objects and create a new object that combines the properties of all the objects.

To merge [objects](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-objects/) into a new one that has all [properties](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-object-properties/) of the merged objects, you have two options:

- Use a spread operator ( `...`)
- Use the `Object.assign()` method

## Merge objects using the spread operator (`...`)

[ES6](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/) introduced the [spread operator](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-spread/) (`...`) which can be used to merge two or more objects and create a new one that has properties of the merged objects.

The following example uses the spread operator (`...`) to merge the `person` and `job` objects into the `employee` object:

```JavaScript
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 25,
    ssn: '123-456-2356'
};


let job = {
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    location: 'USA'
};

let employee = {
    ...person,
    ...job
};

console.log(employee);
```

Output:

```JavaScript
{
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 25,
    ssn: '123-456-2356',
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    location: 'USA'
}
```

If objects have a property with the same name, then the right-most object property overwrites the previous one. For example:

```JavaScript
let job = {
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    country: 'USA'
};

let location = {
    city: 'London',
    country: 'England'
};

let remoteJob = {
    ...job,
    ...location
};

console.log(remoteJob);
```

Output:

```JavaScript
{
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    country: 'England',
    city: 'London'
}
```

In this example, the `job` and `location` has the same property `country`. When we merged these objects, the result object (`remoteJob`) has the `country` property with the value from the second object (`location`).

## Merge objects using `Object.assign()` method

The `Object.assign()` method allows you to copy all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object, and return the target object:

```JavaScript
Object.assign(target, sourceObj1, sourceObj2, ...);
```

Similar to spread operator ( `...`), if the source objects have the same property name, the later object will overwrite the previous object. See the following example:

```JavaScript
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 25,
    ssn: '123-456-2356'
};


let job = {
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    country: 'USA'
};


let employee = Object.assign(person, job);
console.log(employee);
```

Output:

```JavaScript
{
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 25,
    ssn: '123-456-2356',
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    country: 'USA'
}
```

## The Shallow Merge

Both the spread operator ( `...`) and `Object.assign()` method perform a shallow merge. It means that if an object has a property that references to another object, the property of the original object and result target object will reference the same object. For example:

```JavaScript
let person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 25,
    ssn: '123-456-2356',
    contact: {
        phone: '408-989-8745',
        email: 'john.doe@example.com'
    }
};


let job = {
    jobTitle: 'JavaScript Developer',
    location: 'USA'
};

let employee = { ...person,  ...job };

console.log(employee.contact === person.contact);
```

Output:

```JavaScript
true
```

In this example, the `person` object has the `contact` property that references to an object. After merging, the `person` and `employee` object have the `contact` property that reference to the same object.

## The Deep Merge

To recursively merge own and inherited enumerable string keyed properties of source objects to a target object, you can use the [Lodash .\_merge()](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.merge) method:

```JavaScript
_.merge(object, [sources])
```

In this tutorial, you have learned how to merge objects in JavaScript using the spread operator (`...`) and `Object.assign()` method.
