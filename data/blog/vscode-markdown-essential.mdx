I moved from SublimeText to VSCode for almost more than five year's and I'm happy about my productivity.

Most of the time, I'm editing Markdown.

Let me share these 5 extensions which are useful for boosting your productivity on Markdown.

## Markdown All in One

[Markdown All in One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown) is a must one for editing Markdown. It contains Markdown preview,  
keyboard shortcuts, auto preview, and more.

The shortcuts will make editing Markdown much easy:

The completion also contains path finding:

We can print Markdown to HTML with the command: `Markdown: Print current document to HTML`.

Furthermore, it comes with a beautiful Math support:

## Dictionary Completion

[Dictionary Completion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.dictionary-completion) is another extension to help you input English words quicker. Because I'm not a native English speaker, this helps me to write words correctly:

Markdown does not support quick suggestions in default, we need to add the below snippet to make hints appear when type in a Markdown file:

```
"[markdown]": {    "editor.quickSuggestions": true}
```

## Paste Image

I'd love to insert more screenshots to my Markdown files. [Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image) helps me save my images from xclip. This extension supports Mac/Windows/Linux.

## PlantUML

[PlantUML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) is an awesome extension if you need to draw diagrams.  
In PlantUML, diagrams are defined using a [simple and intuitive language](https://plantuml.com/). When you editing the source files of the diagrams, you can also preview the result:

PlantUML supports all kinds of diagrams used by developers, such as sequence diagrams, object and class diagrams, etc.

If you already familiar with Draw.io, you will like another extension [Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio).

## Markdown Emoji

We need more smiles!

[Markdown Emoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-emoji) does one simple thing: add some Emoji faces in your document.

But I found a defect for this extension, my Hexo rendered result does not show Emoji correct in HTML. There is another similar extension [Emoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Perkovec.emoji) solves this issue. And you can even add Emoji in code:

That all, happy editing Markdown!
