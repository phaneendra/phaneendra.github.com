## Error \[ERR_REQUIRE_ESM\]: require() not supported [#](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-error-err-require-esm-require-of-es-module-not-supported#error-err_require_esm-require-not-supported)

The error "\[ERR_REQUIRE_ESM\]: require() not supported" occurs because a package you are importing has been converted to be an ESM only package, which means that the package cannot be imported with `require()` anymore.

**You can solve the "\[ERR_REQUIRE_ESM\]: require() not supported" by doing one of two things:**

1.  Use ESM - use `import foo from 'foo'`, instead of `const foo = require('foo')` and add the following line to your `package.json` file: `"type": "module"`.
2.  Downgrade to the last version of the package that is built with `CommonJS`. (Preferred approach if you're using TypeScript).

The easiest way to solve the error if using `TypeScript` is to downgrade the version of the package to one that is built using CommonJS.

You can see which package is causing the error by looking at the error message in your terminal. The error message in the screenshot above shows that the `node-fetch` package is causing the error.

- [node-fetch](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-error-err-require-esm-of-es-module-node-fetch)

- [got](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-got-error-err-require-esm-of-es-module)

If you go with using ES Modules, you won't be able to use the `require()` syntax to import any other packages and you need to update your import statements to ESM.

```
Copied!// üëáÔ∏è default import
import fetch from 'node-fetch'

// üëáÔ∏è named import
import {myPackage} from 'my-package'

```

You also have to add the following line to your `package.json` file:

```
Copied!{
  "type": "module",
  // üëáÔ∏è ...rest
}

```

You can read more about migrating from CommonJS to ESM by visiting this helpful [Github Readme](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#how-can-i-move-my-commonjs-project-to-esm).

At the time of writing, the best solution I've found (especially if using TypeScript) is to downgrade to the most recent version of the package that is built using CommonJS.

For example, the `node-fetch` package has been converted to be an ESM only package in version `3`, so we have to downgrade to version `2.6.6`, which is the last version that is built with `CommonJS` which enables us to use the `require()` syntax.

To downgrade a package to a specific version, open your terminal in the root directory of your project and run a command that installs the particular version.

```
Copied!npm install node-fetch@2.6.6

# üëáÔ∏è NOTE: you only need this if using TypeScript
npm install --save-dev @types/node-fetch@2.x

```

You can use the `npm install package@X.X.X` syntax to install a specific version of a package.

Once you have installed a version of the package that is built using CommonJS, you will be able to import the package using `require()`.

I strongly suggest you read this [GitHub Readme](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c#how-can-i-move-my-commonjs-project-to-esm) if you want to learn more about why this error occurs and possible fixes.
